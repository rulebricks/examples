## Implementation Examples

This repository contains helpful examples and starter kits for using Rulebricks in your applications.

### Examples

Examples 01-08 are simple examples that demonstrate how to use the Rulebricks SDK in various scenarios.

- [Example 01: Rule Creation & Management](01-rule-creation-management.py)

This example creates a new rule, adds conditions and actions to it, and then solves the rule against a set of inputs.

- [Example 02: Editing Existing Rules](02-editing-existing-rules.py)

This example demonstrates how to retrieve an existing rule, query specific condition rows inside it, edit those conditions, and publish a new version of the rule.

- [Example 03: Using Dynamic Values](03-using-dynamic-values.py)

Dynamic Values in Rulebricks allow you to use variables in your rules that are resolved at runtime. This example demonstrates how to define dynamic values and reference them while programmatically building rules.

- [Example 04: Adding Tests To Rules](04-adding-tests-to-rules.py)

Rulebricks allows you to add tests to your rules to ensure that they always function as expected for every new published version. This example demonstrates how to add tests to a rule, how to enable continuous testing, and what happens when a critical test fails.

- [Example 05: Bulk Rule Administration](05-bulk-rule-administration.py)
- [Example 06: Programmatic Team Management](06-programmatic-team-management.py)

Learn how to invite new users, assign roles, create user (access) groups, and manage team permissions programmatically.

- [Example 07: Analyzing Decision History](07-decision-history-analysis.py)

Rulebricks keeps a detailed history of every decision made by your rules. This example demonstrates how to query the decision history, filter it based on specific criteria, and analyze the results.

- [Example 08: Rule Performance Benchmarking](08-rule-performance-benchmark.py)

### Accelerators

Accelerators are importable rule and flow starter kits that demonstrate using Rulebricks in real-world scenarios, with a higher level of complexity than our built-in templates.
